Please provide suggestions strictly following the following format and requirements:
1. Student basic information analysis:
Analyze this student based on career interest scores, core values, creativity and expressive ability, and MBTI, using natural language. An example output for the input example is:
"1. Student basic information analysis:
Based on our comprehensive understanding of this student's personality profile, interest distribution, and core values, I believe they possess high logical thinking ability and a strong interest in leadership and practical skills. Their dream career is to become a teacher, but given their current personality tendencies, they are better suited to explore diverse development paths within education rather than traditional classroom teaching.
First, in terms of career interests, they excel in leadership (Enterprising) and logical reasoning (Investigative), indicating they enjoy organizing, analyzing, and proactively advancing things, with potential to become an education content planner, education project executor, or educational technology entrepreneur. Additionally, their practical operation ability (Realistic) score is also high, further confirming their suitability for a more practice- and technology-integrated direction in education.
In their core values, they highly value financial security (Finance) and stability of life (Security), meaning they will prefer career paths that both achieve personal goals and provide long-term professional security. Therefore, I suggest they consider exploring areas such as Educational Technology, Business Education, or Education Management within the education field.
Furthermore, as an ISTP type student, they tend to be quiet and independent, not preferring high emotional communication or work environments with rigid frameworks. They are more suited to environments with a certain degree of autonomy, focused on problem-solving and structural design. Therefore, compared to a teacher role facing large classes, they will have better growth space in positions such as content development, personalized education platform development, or educational analysis consulting."

2. FOE
Recommend 3 FOEs selected from ASCED (https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/classifications/australian-standard-classification-education-asced/2001/overview/structure-and-format-asced/field-education#classification-structure). Prioritize the student's dream career (dream_career), then consider family education suggestions (preferred_foe_1, preferred_foe_2, preferred_foe_3). 
1) Most recommended FOE: FOE name
Provide a detailed analysis based on career interest scores, core values, creativity and expressive ability, MBTI, and relevant features in the family background information, expressed in natural language. Include an evaluation analyzing the ideal qualification level for this FOE.
An example output for the input example is:
"After in-depth analysis of this student's characteristics, my top recommended specific direction is: 0701 Education. This field covers professional training from early childhood education, primary education to secondary education, aligning directly with their dream of 'becoming a teacher' and highly matching their logical analysis ability and practical preference.
This student has outstanding logical analysis ability and exploratory spirit. They like to think 'why' and 'how', which makes them proficient in designing curricula, formulating teaching plans, and solving specific teaching problems. 0701 Education is an interdisciplinary field that requires deep understanding of learner development and designing and implementing teaching activities. Whether designing introductory courses for young children or developing thematic units for secondary students, they can leverage their strengths.
From a personality perspective, as an ISTP, they prefer hands-on practice and enjoy the process of autonomous problem solving. Compared to a traditional teacher facing large classes daily, education programs emphasize combining educational theory and teaching practice, providing many internships and classroom observation opportunities, allowing them to continuously adjust and optimize their teaching methods in real teaching environments.
More importantly, their values of 'economic stability' and 'job security' can also be met in this field. Government and society continue to have strong demand for qualified teachers. After completing an education degree, they can obtain a teaching certificate and enjoy the stable career prospects provided by public school tenure. Further study can also lead to education management, curriculum development, or educational research.
From the family background, they are currently studying IB at an international school in Singapore, providing a solid foundation for cross-cultural communication skills and educational theory learning. With a software developer father and a mother in medical management, the family strongly supports professional training and service-oriented careers, helping them better cope with challenges in education internships and teaching projects.
Qualification recommendation: The ideal qualification level for 0701 Education is the undergraduate level. Although a master's degree can bring greater improvements in education management or professional development, a bachelor's degree with teacher qualification is sufficient to start a career and grow through on-the-job experience and training."

3.Recommend Majors
Recommend five majors from different universities based on the above three FOEs, all of which should be from the student's preferred country (preferred_country). The following information must be obtained from the official website of the school (website ending with .edu): For each university official website, find the most suitable major, find the admission requirements for international students (datasets, tables, query websites, etc.), and find the exact score required for the exact exam (secondary_qualification) corresponding to the major. If the exact score cannot be obtained, it must be marked.
The format must be:
Recommendation 1
Recommended University: [Name]
Recommended Major: [Major]
Note: A one-sentence description of the program’s research focus
Required academic qualification exam: (secondary_qualification)
Required score: (converted to a 100-point scale, e.g., 85.0/100)
Special requirements: (usually none; if special exams such as art tests, interviews, portfolios are required, specify type, detailed requirements, and recommended scores)
An example output for the input example is:
"Recommended University: The University of Sydney

4. Improvement suggestions
Generally none. If after analyzing career interest scores, core values, creativity and expressive ability, MBTI, and family background information the student is not well suited for their dream career, provide improvement suggestions for the student or parents, expressed in natural language. An example output for the input example is:
"Although becoming a teacher aligns well with your dream career, based on your interest scores, MBTI type, and core values, traditional classroom teaching may not be the best choice for you. Your 'social' score is low, and teaching often requires continuous, frequent emotional interaction with many students and parents; as an ISTP, you prefer hands-on practice and independent thinking rather than handling complex classroom management and emergencies; additionally, your emphasis on 'financial return' and 'job security' may not be fully met by the relatively flat teacher salary and promotion path.
To better test and develop your teaching potential, we suggest you try small-scale teaching experiences first, such as participating in micro-tutoring classes, community education projects, or summer volunteer teaching, to experience real interactions with few students. Meanwhile, by joining public speaking, debate, or drama clubs, gradually improve your language expression and on-the-spot adaptability, learning to communicate with an audience comfortably. During this process, seeking a mentor with rich teaching experience is also very important; through class observations and feedback discussions, you can quickly master techniques for handling various teaching scenarios and decide if you truly enjoy standing at the podium.
If you find that traditional teaching does not excite you, do not be discouraged. You can consider combining your interests and strengths to move towards roles such as educational technology, curriculum design, or educational consulting. These roles retain the meaning and social value of the education industry while emphasizing project planning, data analysis, and system development, which align with your ISTP personality of independent problem solving and practical results. Please work with your parents to set phased small goals, such as completing a micro-teaching session, giving a public speech, or designing a simple online learning module, and continuously accumulate experience through these practices to ultimately find the career path that best suits you."
