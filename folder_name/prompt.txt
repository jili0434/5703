Brief information:
Dream career (dream_career)
Career interest score and core values (ranked by score from high to low)
MBTI personality type (result_), and briefly explain the advantages or limitations of this personality type in career selection.
Recommend 3-5 most suitable Fields of Education (FOE). If the student's dream career does not align with their actual scores in career interests or core values, you should first recommend suitable FOEs based on score alignment. Then, in the optional section at the end, address how the student may still pursue their dream career, including what adjustments, efforts, or support might be needed.
For each recommended FOE, please provide:
2-3 primary reasons for the recommendation (The recommendation reason must be specific and sufficient, using a natural language style, for example: "The field of education requires high levels of communication (social) and analytical skills (investigative). This student has a high score in communication (social: 35) and stands out in analytical skills (investigative: 40). Therefore, it is recommended that this student pursue this field." Additionally, you should adjust the weight of features appropriately based on the characteristics of the recommended field, for example: For arts-related fields: Considering that these fields often have higher tuition fees, if the student's annual budget (annual_budget_usd) is high, then the weight of the budget feature should be increased.
Engineering or science fields recommendation: Increase the weight of investigative and realistic scores. Management and business fields recommendation: Increase the weight of enterprising and conventional scores. If a student clearly has score deficiencies in a particular area, these should be pointed out.).
Real university and program recommendations within the field (e.g., design programs at UTS, engineering programs at UNSW).
Name of the relevant graduation exam in the recommended university’s country (e.g., GaoKao for China, A-level for the UK, SAT for the US, HSC or VCE for Australia).
Minimum ATAR or corresponding exam score requirement for the recommended university and program (converted to a 100-point scale if necessary).
If the recommended program requires special exams (e.g., art exams, interviews, portfolios), clearly state the type, requirements, and recommended scores.
Typical career ladder or development pathway after graduation from the recommended program.
(Optional) If the recommended field is fully in line with or closely related to your dream career, please do not export this part of the content. If the recommended FOE significantly differs from the student’s dream career and the student insists on pursuing their dream career, please offer specific suggestions for the student or parents to consider. 
Scoring Note:
The student’s career interest scores (artistic, social, investigative, conventional, enterprising, realistic) ,core values (hedonism, power_and_status, altruism, learning_and_achievement, finance, security) and Creativity and Expressive Ability (q1, q2, q3)all range from 0 to 60. When interpreting these scores:
High (30+): Indicates strong alignment or motivation in this dimension.
Moderate (16–30): Indicates mild or secondary alignment.
Low (0–15): Indicates limited interest or relevance and should generally not be cited as a justification for recommendation.
You must clearly justify each recommendation based on high or moderate scores, and avoid referencing low scores as supporting evidence. If necessary, low scores may be mentioned to explain why a field may not fit.
